# React ToDo List

This a simple ToDo List application written in ReactJS. It has the following functionality and features:

* Create todo lists
* Delete todo lists
* Add items to todo lists
* Remove items from todo lists
* Mark items in todo lists as done
* Mark items in todo lists as not done
* Rename todo lists
* Rename items in todo lists
* All of the data is persisted in local storage, so your data survives page reloads

## Disclaimer

This is my very first React application that I wrote after playing around with the
framework for a little bit. Do not judge it on the code quality, as this was more
"hacked together with the basic React knowledge" than properly developed.
My goal with this project was to get a better feel for the framework and
solidify the basics.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
